#Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
#Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

#Examples:
#6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
#37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

#Given:
#range:
#start = 25
#end = 50

#Expected output:
#Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
#29
#31
#37
#41
#43
#47

start = input('Enter the range start:')
end = input('Enter the range end:')

number_range = []
for x in range(int(start), int(end)+1, 1):
     number_range.append(x)

for i in number_range:
    if i > 1:
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i % j == 0: break
        else: print(i)
